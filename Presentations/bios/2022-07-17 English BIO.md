I've been a programmer since childhood.
I started my commercial journey 6 years ago.
My last position was Senior Software developer at Goodnotes company.

I love technology and people.
I have a holistic approach to development.
I have broad knowledge of technology and I love teaching people and seeing them grow.
Lately, I found DDD as a great connector of business needs and software development.
I specialize in architecture.

Currently, I am having 1 year break.
I'm looking for consulting opportunities and other side projects.
I'm in progress of organising DDD meetup in Gda≈Ñsk.
I'm actively looking for mentors and mentees.
