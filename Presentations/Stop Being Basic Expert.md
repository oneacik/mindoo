Presentation about how not learning basics interferes with our future career

Not knowing = uncertainty

Experience:

When we do something advanced we tend to try to workaround something because we don't know basics.
If there are too many uncertainties we tend to make shortcuts, not learning the basics.
Noting is the way of understanding what we lack.
Creating a plan is giving us certainty what we need to achieve the goal - therefore we are more willing to go this direction.

- Why should we learn more
	- We don't know what we don't know
	- Those things may make our life much better
