- Collaboration problems
	- Foundation like DevOPs too small to handle us correctly
	- Team in different Timezones
		- Feeling alone
		- Lack of team support
- Doing what we should
	- Roadmap not aligned with our skills
	- Not doing what I love
	- No work that fits my skills
	- Some are beingoverwhelmed by work
- Tasks with no granular progress
- Spiralling: When I need to do something that I don't want -> procrastination -> then stress of not doing anything -> thinking and working after hours to deliver something




When I feel that something is not good:
- I should stop doing it
- Ask for help
