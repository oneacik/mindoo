I met him on [[Jak bÄ™dzie W Maszynie Turinga]]
He is quite utilitarian person, and he looks mostly for profit for himself.
However, I think that his approach is also benefiting the others as you can't do good for yourself if you don't do good for the others.

He also is a good architecture advocate and knowledge advocate.
