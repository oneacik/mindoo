Arkadiusz Klej is a scholar.
I met him at [[Active Students X-MAS Party]].
He creates masterclasses.
He told me about the **tutoring**.
His main project was creating map of global problems for universities.
He created an enforced learning piano for [[Gdynia Design Days]].
**I want to got for his masterclasses for learning.**
