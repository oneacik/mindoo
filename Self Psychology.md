## Thought resets
Sometimes when I am thinking about some stressing decisions that may hurt someone, I reset my path of thinking and have to start again. It feels like I am traumatized in some way that fires when conflict may occur, trying to escape me from those thoughts. No idea what it is.

## Hating doing big ball of mud
Lot of uncertainties that I'd like just to refactor, but I can't ;-;
I think that we should keep code ownership and not edit the code of other people.
