## 116 - 2.8 Uncertainty Domain

**Glossary**
- Uncertainty
- Ambiguity
- Complexity
- Volatility
- Risk

Uncertainty in the broadest sense is a state of not knowing or unpredictability:
- Risk associated with not knowing future events
- Ambiguity associated with not being aware of current or future conditions
- Complexity associated with dynamic systems having unpredictable outcomes

**2.8.1 - Responding to uncertainty**
- Gather Information
- Prepare for multiple outcomes
- Set-based design: Many possible design to see many possible outcomes
- Build in resilience

**2.8.2 - Ambiguity**
Solutions for exploration of ambiguity:
- Progressive elaboration - iterative process of increasing the level of detail
- Experiments
- Prototypes

**2.8.3 - Complexity**
Tackling Complexity:
- System Based
	- Decoupling - for example Microservices
	- Simulation
- Reframing - changing the perspective
	- Diversity - Inviting people from out of the box
	- Balance
- Process-Based
	- Iterate
	- Engage
	- Fail Safe

**2.8.4 - Volatility**
Tackling Volatility:
- Alternative Analysis
- Reserve - for example for price volatility

**2.8.5 - Risk**

Threat profile is a nice way to visiualize threats and change to them

- Threats
    - Avoid
    - Escalate
    - Transfer - to 3rd party
    - Mitigate - reduce probability
    - Accept
- Opportunities
    - Exploit
    - Escalate
    - Share
    - Enhance
    - Accept

**2.8.6 Interaction with other performance domains**
- Risk interacts with:
    - Planning
    - Project Work
    - Delivery
    - Measurement
