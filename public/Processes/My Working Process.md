## Principles

- NEGOTIATE
- Facilitate
- Use juniors
- Persist Knowledge
- Understand motivation

## Practices

- Time Management
    - [[task warrior]]
        - For tasks just taskwarrior
        - Two calendars life/work synced to task warrior - for schedulable tasks which I will forget to do
- Processes
    - Retrospectives with impact/effort/mood matrix
    - [[Feature Dependency Breakdown Process]]


## Problems to solve

- Knowlegde not persisted = we often learn something which we don't incorporate into process. Example:
    - We learn how to create a good alert but we don't have templates for it

## Workarounds for my personality

- I need to understand expectations for person I am working with
- Before I get any deeper into the topic I will be working with I need to understand it first
- I am not working on code of rock star programmers (it means code that is unreadable and understandable only by person writing it)
