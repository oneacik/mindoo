126: Choose the **right authority** level:
1. Tell - Tell what to do (no empowerment)
2. Sell - Tell what to do, but try to sell to coworkers
3. Consult - Ask for advice on decision, but decide yourself
4. Agree - Ask for agreement on decision
5. Advise - Delegate, but advise how it should be done
6. Inquire - Delegate but inquire from time to time
7. Delegate

**132**: See for: Delegation checklist for choosing **right maturity** level and **authority level**
