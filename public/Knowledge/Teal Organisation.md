Teal Organization seems like a strange concept.
In [[Management 3.0]] it was said that a person feels well when he is in an environment where he can use the best of his skills.
Teal enforces him to do also other things like management, and it may not be good thing.
Influence is nice, but have you ever thought of not having context switch?
