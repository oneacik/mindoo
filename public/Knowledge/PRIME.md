[Facebook Event](https://www.facebook.com/events/3745563422375817)

#### Notes

- Work Speaks for itself? NAh - You need to communicate!!!
  - What the second side needs to hear to want something?
**You are only as good as what you can communicate!**

##### PRIME - HOW TO SPEEK

**P.R.I.M.E.**
1. P - Pause: To accent, to get comfortable with silence.
1. R - Rate Of Speech: Slow for accent, attention / Default for everything else / Fast for? Do not be in default speed.
1. I - INTENSITY: Volume and Energy. Voice and gestures.
1. M - Melody: Rhythym and variety + **pitch**??
1. E - Emotions - sounds and mimics

How to train?
One at the time - best to work on something that we really don't like.

##### Shaping the Communication

There is no fast thinking and slow thinking - first person uses frameworks.

Frameworks:
- Create framework on the spot
- **P.R.E.P.**
  - Point
  - Reason
  - Example
  - Point (Again)
- **CePeBE**
  - Context
  - Problem
  - Big Idea
  - Elaboration

- You can either pull person on your level
- Or go onto their level

Cycle:
learn -> practice (prompt feedback) -> master when to use them? -> AGAIN
