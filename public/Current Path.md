## What I hate of myself

- Making friends with wrong people
- Not saying what I have on my mind
- Being always nice
- Not saying complements to people
- Not meeting new people and regretting afterwards

## Action Points

1. Create your own boundaries and don't allow to cross them
2. Be open to people and don't waste a chance to meet them
3. Let go projects that are failing by itself
