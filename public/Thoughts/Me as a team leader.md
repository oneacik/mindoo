What I want:

- DDD!!!
- Great Autonomy
- MONEY (How can I buy an apartement in this Economics without a credit?)
- Being support not the stressed pivot
- Contribute to open source
- Go in consultant direction

My idea for leadership:
- What I like best matrix
	- Development Responsibilities
	- Speaker predispositions
	- Business Responsibilities
	- Knowledge Sharing Responsibilities
	- Leadership Responsibilities
	- **Purpose:** Give people to do stuff they really love
- Theory X/Y
	- **Purpose:** Don't take unmotivated people for the critical responsibilities / give them repetetive boring stuff xd
- I want to create a new leader from a team
	- **How:** By making notes of my routines and sharing them with people
- 1 minute manager
	- Invest only 40% of time for a team
