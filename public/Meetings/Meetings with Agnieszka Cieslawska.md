| 1   | 1-2-4              | Remember good and bad situations and share them to get feedback if they are understandable and inspire others | People were not quite inspired with other people's situations and didn't get much feedback on their cards                   |
| 2   | 5 whys in pair     | Understanding why this situations were important for us                                                       | It greatly refined and reduced situations to the core                                                                       |

Overally:
 We created quite a big list of principles covering most of our culture - [[Lista pryncypalek hsp]]

## Idea for workshop

1. On the small meeting get ideas of the important lifecycles in the lifecycle of the company
2. Organise panarchy workshop and for each ecocycle try to assign DomainDrivenDesign and Project Management techniques used
3. Use Shift&Share using half of the group of each table to share the findings
