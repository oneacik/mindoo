- Birth
    - Understanding why something is done (5whys)
    - First you need to understand the architecture, then work on it
    - Pair coding
        - Pair coding is great to learn more complex things in project domain
        - Code With Me is great for pair coding
    - Pair coding vs C4 - it depends
        - There are many levels that you try to understand:
            - Business - [[Event Storming]]
            - System - [[Presentations Knowledge Aggregate|C4]]
            - Infra - UML
            - Code
        - Code allows you to understand many layers
    - Conways Law is a very important problem to address
        - Why: Because teams are not aligned with real bounded contexts
        - Read [[Table of Knowledge|Team Topologies]]
    - **It is great to have own team to learn their problems**
    - 500s are great to detect problems and should be reduced to 0
    - Authority = Bigger cost of a mistake
    - Before Experimenting - Have a sparring with people to get to unknown unknowns
    - Architect should dirty his hands with code - it builds his credability
        - When you build trust you can spend this points without a need to convince people
    - **It is important to communicate that first you are learning and you don't want to experiment in blind**
    - Metrics are best measured year-over-year or even bigger period
        - Because months influence them
    - North Style Business
    - ADRs should be in code
- Maturity
    - Changes WILL break software
    - [[Table of Knowledge|Enterprise Integration Patterns]] - may talk about migrations
        - Migration: Expand & Collapse
        - Strangler Pattern
    - Code Review
        - It bonds you with team you are caring for
        - Talk instead of pingpong in comments on Code Review
        - Create code patches for review
            - People will like you
            - And you will be coding :)
        - By having external services
            - You are paying for building anticorruption layers to yours
    - Important is to be a person who delivers improvements
    - Architect that works alone is the worst sort
    - **Architect is an agile coach but technical one**
    - Big meetings suck
