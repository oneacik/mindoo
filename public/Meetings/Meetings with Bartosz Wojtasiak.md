## Discussion

Krzysztof Rudnicki - person interested in DDD
No idea if C# meetup in objectivity will happen which is around 

Recruitment is the most important aspect of sponsorship
Sponsors will find themselves after we grow meetup
It is important not to look from outside like hosting something under organisation, because it will limit amount of people coming

End of this week or the next for me:
- [ ] What are we doing and for whom - prepare a marketing pack
- [ ] Write to the people from some of companies

and for Bartosz:
- [x] He will send me a list of companies -> [[Companies in Tricity]]
- [ ] Hosting the event
