    - Communication
    - Lubricates the communication

Programming is not the main part
Scope
Documentation to convince people

Proactivity is the best
They listen by talking with people

*Sale* is an ongoing process - it is like a garden
Understanding their needs and doing checkins
Sometimes they will have no problems,
but because you are with those people they will know who to talk to.

1-1s are very nice to bump topic - you can tune the frequency.
You will get the vibe of people.

Politics is not negative.
People running around trying to find a place to get most impact.

When people know that you are problem solver,
then THEY will proactively contact you.

### Sales Pitch

- establish benchmark
- have spreadsheet of problems company has - effort/impact
    - time
    - money
    - *ask other people/business for potential impact*
- Try to convince people by talking
    - A lot of things are chosen arbitrally
        - Credit Karma: CEO has just decided it because he didn't like Scala
        - Hype Train, just in the gut
- Reversible Decisions can be taken lightly
    - Non reversible should be tested

### How not to be pushed around

Don't get retroactivated by your leader
Push back business people - use analogies and methaphors

Negotiate!
Key phrases:
- Drop less important projects
    - Things need to have priority
- Cut scope on some things

Principal engineers 

### Project Management

**Role of tech lead:** Person that organises the meetings
- The tech lead defined
    - Roadmap
    - Complexity of tasks
        - For Juniors, etc.
- You need to have basics
    - It helps you communicate with managers
    - And other people

Having data well visualized makes working with person experience better.

### Being best manager

Having no ego,
and staying out of technical details - made him a better manager.
More Facilitation to get the knowledge from other people.

### Data Queries

I would just go to the data scientist.
Or sometimes it is just already there in grafana.

Not all decisions need data.
Data sometimes excavates new stuff.
Sometimes you need to find the charts.

Engineering is usually a metric driven.
Not always it needs to be translated to money.
