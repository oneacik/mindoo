### Definition

**Function Purpose:** Build company relations so we can cooperate with them
**Expected Results**: Fill and develop this table and [[Companies in Tricity]]

### Hints
- On linkedin look for people in a given company - look for **employer branding**, then **hrs**, then **others**
- Try to arrange a meeting to seal the deal
	- When arranging the meeting **be clear with its agenda**
	- Agenda should cover things needed to cover all the fill in tables
- It is worth to present what DDD meetup is and what is expected amount of people
