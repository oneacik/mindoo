### Definition

**Function Purpose:** Build company relations so we can cooperate with them
**Expected Results**: Fill and develop this table and [[Companies in Tricity]]

### Hints
- On linkedin look for people in a given company - look for **employer branding**, then **hrs**, then **others**
- Write to few people (for example 2-3 ppl), even if it is not urgent
- Try to arrange a meeting to seal the deal
	- When arranging the meeting **be clear with its agenda**
	- Agenda should cover things needed to cover all the fill in tables
- It is good to start with a note containing information about DDD meetup
    - What is DDD
    - For whom it is
