# Meritocratic Strategy

## Vision - Purpose To Practice 

**Purpose:** 
- Gather intel how to organise best meetup & make proper DDD more recognizable in Tricity
- Organise engaging meetups that give more energy than they take
- Create an extensive instruction about organising meetups
- Prepare people to use DDD techniques in their work
- Make DDD used wider at Tricity companies
- Facilitate knowledge sharing between companies

**Principals:**
- Cooperate with different sponsors, so we can easily get people and advertising from different companies 
- Use engaging techniques, so people will get more energy than they lose
- Support the community lifecycle
    - First: Pick topics that can be used even in non DDD environment + build awareness of DDD
    - Second: Introduce techniques that allow for migrating to DDD environment + build awarenes of the need of change
    - Third: Introduce techniques for improving DDD environment
    - Fourth: Facilitate experience sharing
- Delegate as much of the work on the meetup to other people, so we can share knowledge and bring new perspective into it
- Always get feedback, to create a better meetup and develop proper instruction for organising it

**Participants:**
- Developers - so there is talent that can properly use DDD
- Managers, Leaders - to build awareness and need of DDD in projects in people who have the power
- Facilitators - so DDD techniques can be swiftly applied without slashback

Structure: TBD

Practices:
1. Mob workshop building - so we can together in a group create a new workshops
1. Workshops
1. Lean Coffee
1. Gathering Information: Generating topics ->

    1. Build awareness of strategic design (Wardley Mapping, Defining Boundary Contexts, Team Topologies?)
    1. Technical Design of architecture at scale (Event Driven Architecture)
    1. Project Management tools around DDD 
1. Maturity - people know how to use DDD; tackling with problems and optimising
    1. Convincing to use DDD
    1. Refactoring around DDD
    1. How to build teams around DDD
    1. Coping and describing complexity
1. Creative Destruction
