It is very important to do this part right.
You need to be exhaustive and to find as many important details as possible.
It will be a base to forming problems and knowing what to empathise about.

Ad 1.4
People may not have visited Kolonia before this meeting.
**Ask:** What are things that you are looking for in art cafes.
**Then you may follow:** what needs is Kolonia fulfilling for you and what is it lacking for you

Each person should be ask by a group and it should take 10-15 minutes per person.
Treat it as an interview, you want to understand better others and finally yourself.
One person should be designated to write highlights of other thoughts on sticky notes.

Fishbone analysis is just asking "why" enough times for the problem.
There may be many answers for one "why" therefore it starts to form tree or fishbone structure.
It is important to get as deep as possible to find the real cause for a main problem.
You often may find yourself exploring psychological and sociological problems when going deep into analysis.
