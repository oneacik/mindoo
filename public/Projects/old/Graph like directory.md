- tree is not optimal for directory structure
- in scripts some files need to use some other files and know nothing about the rest
- when we look on files like linked directories then we can measure
	- how many files it depends on
	- how many files are depending on it
	- What is the longest critical chain of all operations
	- See how many files in a directory are totally unrelated to the file
