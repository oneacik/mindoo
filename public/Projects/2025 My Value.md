## What Is

I am looking for contracts... preferrably short-contracts, goal based.
See a section beneath to understand [whoami](2025 My Value#What Was).

### What can be your problems

- **Lack of any strategy and structure in the organisation on any level**
- Meetings not contributing to its goals (if even exist)
- Poor Developer Experience resulting in burnout, stress, reduced performance, churn.
- Lack of knowledge in software development resulting on bad design decisions therefore low performance
- And others... I am not limited to those problems and talking extends our perspectives

### How I solve them?

This is example of how cooperation with me could look like

1. Agreement on the following structure
1. Gathering Information
    1. Talking with manager or interested person about most crucial pain points
    1. Organizing **engaging workshop to define pain points** with teams
        1. Techniques that are employed for this, include
            1. Retrospectives
            1. [Triz](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/6-making-space-with-triz/)
            1. [Crowd Sourcing](https://www.liberatingstructures.com/12-2510-crowd-sourcing/)
            1. [1-2-4-All]
            1. And many others when I see fit for the meeting
        1. They contribute to parallel engagement of the whole workshop groups
    1. **Prioritizing and agreeing on improvement solutions** for organisation
    1. Defining and agreeing on **metrics for those solutions**
1. Implementation depending on the type of problem may use few of these techniques
    1. Workshops
    1. Change Management using [ADKAR](https://www.prosci.com/methodology/adkar)
    1. Development Project

### What important personality traits should convince you

**Love for structure**
I know many structures that are liberating for thought and action. 
I've seen how lack of those caused chaos and undelivered promises.

**Teal Management and Management 3.0 adept**
I have experience in managing without force. 
I operate on needs and try to sell solutions based on this.
Ask don't tell.

**Holistic Approach**
I am profficient in Architecture, Development, Facilitation, Project Management, Management.
This allows me to understand CEOs and developers the same.
You will understand my language and I will understand yours.

**Love for Learning**
You can get from me edge cutting solutions that can fix your problems.
I get them from conferences, books I read and people I meet.
You will be surprised how different fields of expertise may solve problems in new ways.

**After Learning Comes Teaching**
I love sharing techniques that I use.
If only people are willing to grow, then my knowledge will be yours sustaining your growth.

### How can we cooperate? 

I prefer short burst (1 week to 3 months) projects.
Even if we would like to work long term, I need time to learn and regenerate.
Consultant work requires time to be creative, day-to-day work is killing it.

I'd prefer we sign contracts based on hourly-rate for the deliverable.
After it to sign another one for another.

I am not crossing out full time contracts - however they would be less preferable.
**However who I am to set things in stone? You can always convince me to anything as long as we agree :)**

In fact in any role **with autonomy** I will grow and **refactor approaches from different parts of organisation**.

## What Was

### My Projects

#### Hackerspace Pomorze

I am in a board of [Hackerspace Pomorze](https://hsp.sh).
I was focusing mostly on removing obstacles and improvements.

During my terms I was the person leading hard processes of dumping problematic people.
It was the process with addition of psychotherapy that allowed me to build caring but strong personality.

My most important projects:
- Delegation of finances to motivated people outside of the board: 
    - Allowed to be always of time in payments and gave people feeling of being important
- Pushed SSO introduction
    - Allowed for easy onboarding to services for members
- Creation of onboarding process on Wiki
    - Mostly facilitated learning process so people know their rights and perks
    - People are instantly onboarded to SSO so there is no delay in getting accesses.
- Creation of rule book
    - Allows us to better resolve conflicts and have more clearer vision

Because of it:
- Stability of organisation has risen and people are solving hard conflicts
- There is constant flow of new people and almost no regrettable churn of old ones
- New leadership is slowly emerging
- I am feeling like I can handover this organisation to the next generation because they got so mature

For me it is a greatest example of my leadership.
**And I stayed to my values of being extremely creative, goal oriented and unhinged.**
I feel that because of being open to my emotions and saying what I think we could grow and succeed in hard times.

#### Conceptual Book Club

[[Book Club]] is my new initiative.
It's goal is to build relations based on common interest:
Books changing the way we do, believe, think.

I have introduced there many techniques based on **Liberating Structures**.
**improving greatly people engagement and ability to build relations.**

As it is going **it is a great success as I am meeting people that inspire me**.
Something completely different from other meetings.

#### DDD-GDA

DDD-GDA was a year and a half long Domain Driven Design meetup.
I managed to create a group here of great people (leadership group) that allowed me to push it further.
With some of them I even meet from time to time :).

We were prioritising our work by strategy meetings in leadership group.
We managed to conduct many workshops with people in consulting business like:
Jakub Pilimun, Mariusz Gil, Mike Wojtyna.
We were learning those techniques by organizing bigger workshops by ourselves.
We were facilitating knowledge sharing and engagement by **liberating structures** and **lean coffee**.

I was trying to handover the project to the other people however it failed as they didn't have enough time.
I am still **looking for a mentor** to coach me about **succession and delegation**.
In many other projects I focus on this part to grow in it.

**It was a very important project for me that allowed me to become a facilitator and architect.**
Many people are still asking me if I will continue it 
and currently I am trying **to give them tools to organise it without me**.

### Kinguin

#### Overall

Kinguin made me understand that I am really good in my facilitation, project management, architectural, developer work.
By structure I managed to point the directions and deliver things beyond standard approach of deployed, but to real effect.


#### Did

1. Workshops
    1. Docker
    1. Kubernetes
1. Facilitation
    1. Leading Coordination meetings in whole company
    1. Services Blueprint visualization for guest checkout project
    1. User Story Mapping for Subscription project
1. Project Management
    1. Kinguin Host
        1. Prioritisation and dependency management
        1. Unblocking people by local development environment in nix
1. Change Management
    1. DoR & DoD Introduction
    1. Application of Structurizr (C4 Documentation) and Sonarqube


#### Result

##### Kinguin Host

I joined **Kinguin Host project** as a Scrum Master and Developer.
I was prioritising the work to ship the MVP as fast as possible.
I was using **user story mapping** technique to prioritise the work **to postpone improvements to critical path to later**.

My work resulted in structurized project which **reduced coordination time** and **minimized cognitive load** on developers.
Because of that we could chill and move fast - because we didn't have any unnecessary long meetings.
We were able to **finish plannings in 15 minutes** and refinements were as long as necessary.

My role as a developer was to unblock the work of developers.
I was able to create a local development environment in **nix and docker** that **allows anybody to spin local development in 5 minutes by three commands**.
It greatly accelerated development speed.
**Improving Developer Experience is one of my favorite themes of work.**

##### Change Management - C4

Because of attaching C4 process to jira process the developers were reminded of filling it.
Because of it C4 is slowly being populated by new connections.

C4 model is being used by external contributors and new team members to onboard on the architecture.
Also it is being used by developers and architecture to remind of the structure of current architecture in important decisions.

##### DoR & DoD Introduction

I managed to modify and iterate on jira flow.
DoR is implemented as a issue template that allows people to organize their work.
DoD is implemented as a small checklist when moving task to done.

Those are process extension points that can be used by teams to reinforce the process and guide change management in this scope.
Example: Teams remember to fill C4 documentation at the end of the task (or automatically task for it will be created if skipped)
and remember to define acceptance criteria to tasks.

##### Sonarqube

Sonarqube development resulted in ability to measure the quality of project.
After introduction of it detected bugs in project stopped rising and were able to decrease.
It is hard to say what was the real impact of this project as it was given from the top of management.
IMO workshops on architecture, microservices and correct coding practices could result in better results.
