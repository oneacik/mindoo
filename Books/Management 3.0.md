### 7: How to empower teams

120: Managers create motivational debt by being bossy. People don't want to be told what to do, they want to be asked.

121: It is better to be "one-minute manager" than full time manager

122: People Managers don't know much about managing people. They never read:
*First Break All The Rules, Peopleware, The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership*.

124: Giving power to your people doesn't diminish your own status. Quite the reverse. It is more likely to increase it.

125: Choose the **right maturity** level for the person:
Low Maturity: Low risk; like organizing integration parties
Medium Maturity: Medium Risk; interviewing job candidates
High Maturity: High Risk; Crucial product decisions for the company

126: Choose the **right authority** level:
1. Tell - Tell what to do (no empowerment)
2. Sell - Tell what to do, but try to sell to coworkers
3. Consult - Ask for advice on decision, but decide yourself
4. Agree - Ask for agreement on decision
5. Advise - Delegate, but advise how it should be done
6. Inquire - Delegate but inquire from time to time
7. Delegate

**132**: See for: Delegation checklist for choosing **right maturity** level and **authority level**

134: Delegation is an investment. People first will be less performative than you yourself. 

136: Explicitly stating what is your delegation checklist will help you discuss what can be improved, when you fuck up, with the person you report to. Relates to: [[Presentation - Being Explicit]] 

**136**: Working environment should be perfectly balanced between wellbeing of employees and other requirements. Relates to: [[Your work shouldn't obstruct other people work]]

139: You earn trust from people just by simply doing stuff you committed to; see [[Building Trust]]

140: If you want to be trusted, then first trust yourself. Learn to create plans that you can fulfill.

143: To know what people think about you, just ask those questions:
- What is it that I should stop doing
- What is it that I should start doing
- What is it that I should continue doing
