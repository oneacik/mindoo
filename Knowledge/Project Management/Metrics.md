Metrics are a way to measure stuff.
It was mentioned in [[Lean Startup Book Presentation]].

### Measuring impact

Sometimes to measure the impact on something,
you need first to have those some metrics already measured.
For example, code refactor impact may be measured by [[Burndown Chart]].
However, it needs for sprints to be estimated first.
We can also use indirect metrics like code smells from [[SonarQube]].
