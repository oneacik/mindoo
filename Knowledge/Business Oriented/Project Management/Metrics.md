Metrics are a way to measure stuff.
It was mentioned in [[RDY Lean Startup Book Presentation]].

### Measuring impact

Sometimes to measure the impact of something,
you need first to have those some metrics already measured.
For example, code refactor impact may be measured by [[Burndown Chart]].
However, it requires for sprints to be estimated first.
We can also use indirect metrics like code smells from [[SonarQube]].
